## Well done

You have successfully completed the codelab and learnt how to build a Firefly React app using fundamental React knowledge and React Spectrum components.

### Achievements

You have learned: 

* How to use [aio-lib-state](https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-state) as part of Runtime actions.
* How to bind React Spectrum components to Runtime actions.    

### What's next ?

Type checking React properties is already possible in JavaScript using `prop-types`. 
If you want to go further and write Typed JavaScript inside a Firefly App for your Runtime actions and React app, we'll show you how to in the upcoming codelab **Using TypeScript to develop a Project Firefly app**.
